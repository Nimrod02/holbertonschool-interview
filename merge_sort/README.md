## Introduction
This project implements the Merge Sort algorithm, a popular comparison-based sorting algorithm. Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and easy-to-implement sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the understanding of the algorithm through a series of coding tasks.

## Requirements
- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Operating System**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- **Compiler**: Programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
- **Code Style**: 
  - Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
  - All files should end with a new line
  - No global variables are allowed
  - No more than 5 functions per file
- **Standard Library**: 
  - Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. 
  - Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. is totally forbidden.

## Usage

### Compilation
To compile the code, use the following command:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <file_name.c> -o <output_name>
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-merge_sort.c`: Contains the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.
- `sort.h`: The header file contains the library and the project prototype.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Authors
- **Alexa Orrico**, Software Engineer at Holberton School (for the creation of the exercice)
- **Arthur Letrun**, (me) For code production
