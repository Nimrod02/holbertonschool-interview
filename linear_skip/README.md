# Project Name: Linear Search in Skip List

![Project Image](link-to-project-image)

## 📝 Description
This project implements a linear search algorithm within a skip list data structure, designed to optimize search operations by skipping through a subset of the elements. This method combines the simplicity of linear search with the efficiency of hierarchical indexing, offering an innovative approach to searching in ordered lists.
