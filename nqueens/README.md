## üìù Description
The N Queens Project is a sophisticated software challenge that tasks participants with placing N queens on an N√óN chessboard in such a manner that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. This project combines algorithms, optimization, and computational thinking to solve a problem that scales in complexity with the size of the board.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used
- **Python**: Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in algorithm development.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for its array-handling capabilities, facilitating board state management.
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and project management.

## üìã Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.8 or later)
- **NumPy** (latest version recommended)
- Git

## üöÄ Installation and Configuration
1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/user/NQueensProject.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd NQueensProject`
3. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üí° Usage
- To solve the N Queens problem for a board of size N: `python n_queens_solver.py --size=N`
- Example: `python n_queens_solver.py --size=8`

## ‚ú® Main Features
1. **Dynamic Board Size**: The program can compute solutions for any board size, not just 8.
2. **Multiple Solution Finding**: Capable of finding all possible solutions for a given board size.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Tracks and displays computation time and the number of solutions found.
