## 📝 Description
"Rain" is a software engineering project focused on solving a practical problem in computational geometry: calculating the amount of rainwater trapped between walls of different heights. This project simulates a rainwater trapping scenario using a list of non-negative integers to represent wall heights, where the width of each wall is 1 unit. It is especially useful for educational purposes in teaching algorithms related to array manipulation and optimization techniques.

## 📚 Resources
- Python 3.4.3
- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- PEP 8 style guidelines

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
- **Python:** Chosen for its readability and efficiency in handling array manipulations.
- **Ubuntu:** Required environment for consistent testing and deployment across different setups.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.4.3 installed
- Access to a Unix-like operating system, preferably Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Basic familiarity with terminal and Python scripting

## 📊 Data Files
No specific data files outside of the provided Python scripts.

## 🚀 Installation and Configuration
1. Ensure Python 3.4.3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
`git clone https://github.com/Nimrod02/holbertonschool-interview.git`

3. Navigate to the `rain` directory.

## 💡 Usage
To run the program:

`python3 0_main.py`

This will execute the script and print the amount of rainwater trapped between the walls defined in the script.

## ✨ Main Features
1. **Rainwater Calculation:** Calculates the total amount of rainwater trapped after it rains.
2. **Optimized Performance:** Efficiently handles large lists of wall heights without performance degradation.
