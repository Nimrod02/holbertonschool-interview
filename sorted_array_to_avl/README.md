## 📝 Description
The "Array to AVL" project is a sophisticated software solution designed to convert a simple array into a balanced AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) binary tree. This transformation ensures that the tree remains balanced at all times, offering optimal search, insertion, and deletion times. Key features of this project include efficient memory management, the implementation of rotation operations for maintaining tree balance, and a user-friendly interface for visualizing the tree structure.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
- **C Programming Language**: Chosen for its close-to-hardware operation capabilities, which allows for efficient memory management and performance.
- **Git**: For version control and collaborative development.
- **Visual Studio Code**: As an IDE for code development and debugging.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler: Version 7.5.0 or newer.
- Git: For cloning the repository and contributing to the project.
- Basic understanding of data structures, especially binary trees.

## 🚀 Installation and Configuration
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Nimrod02/holbertonschool-interview`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd array-to-avl`
3. Compile the project: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-sorted_array_to_avl.c -o 0-sorted_array_to_avl`
4. Run the executable: `./0-array_to_avl`

## 💡 Usage
To use the "Array to AVL" software, simply run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions to input your array. The software will automatically convert it into an AVL tree and display the resulting tree structure.

## ✨ Main Features
1. **Array to AVL Conversion**: Efficiently transforms an input array into a balanced AVL tree.
2. **Balance Maintenance**: Implements rotation operations to ensure the tree remains balanced after each insertion or deletion.
3. **Visualization**: Provides a simple yet effective visualization of the AVL tree structure.
